This how I learned python.
It has most of my notes, anything I did in python in the begginning and to sort of understand the syntax

Getting  started with Python is easy. First, Make sure you have python installed. To install python, visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/ This is easy on mac, but windows may require more work. Youtube installing python on windows and you should be up and running in no time.

Next install your favorite text editor or IDE. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, in fact, most native text editors can handle the job pretty well (particulary in linux). However, I recommend sublime as it seems to be the most lightweight. If you plan on doing any serious programming however, take a look at visual studio code or ATOM. These more advanced IDE's come with nice linters and can help you write code by predicting and autofilling.
